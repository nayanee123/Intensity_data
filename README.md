# Intensity_dataAnalysis (Build your own model using NLP and Python) 

The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in the text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and process data, the system will predict the intensity where its happiness, angriness or sadness. This predictive capability will enable to proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction

proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

# Activity :

	Data Collection: Gather all the intensity data, including the text and its intensity.

	Data Preprocessing: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.

	Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and identify key process variables that impact intensity.

	Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for intensity classification.

	Model Training: Train the selected models using the preprocessed data.

	Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.

	Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time predictions.
